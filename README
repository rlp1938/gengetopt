README for gengo.

A program to generate code to process options for command line programs.
 It works in 2 stages:
 1. gengo -i optstring
 where optstring is of the form used for short options. See man 3 getopt
 2. gengo -g program_name.

 Stage 1 generates intermediate files which are editable and the stage 2
 operates on such files to generate the program files, main.c,
 getoptions.h and getoptions.c

 There are a number of boilerplate files which on first run will be
 installed in $HOME/.config/gengo/. These files may be edited to suit
 but be aware that there are many C style comments eg /* comment */
 located at the beginning of lines. These are used at the generation
 stage so do not edit or remove these lines.

 BUGS: The man page mentions long options. This feature is not yet implemented but will be ASAP.

 The makefile generated is minimal and is really only suitable for a
 test build after program generation. If no 'Makefile' exists at program
 generation it will be so named, otherwise it is named 'Makefile.gdb'.
 makefile will be named "Makefile.gdb" so it won't clash with anything
 produced by autotools. It's entire purpose is to build the program
 with optimisation at level 0 for using gdb.
