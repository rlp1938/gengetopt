.SH NAME

.P
\fBgengo\fR \- generates getoptions subroutine and header.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.P
\fBgengo\fR \-i [option] option_string

.P
\fBgengo\fR \-g [option] program_name

.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
\fBgengo\fR is an interactive program that operates on the
user provided option string and generates
\fIgetoptions.c\fR and \fIgetoptions.h\fR together with a
workable \fImain.c\fR in accordance with the answers given.

.P
The options string output will begin with ":h". You may
preface your provided options string with this or not as you
wish. If not provided the program will do it.

.P
`make` followed by `./program_name \-h` should get you the
help listing before you add anything to your new program.

.P
On first run the following files will be written to
\fI$HOME/.config/gengo/; //main.bp\fR, \fImainhdr.bp\fR,
\fIgetoptions.bp\fR, \fIMakefileBP\fR and \fIgetoptions.bp\fR.
You may edit these files as required. However, be aware that there are
many old C style comments on new lines within these files that are used
as targets during processing. These should be left alone.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
 \fB\-h\fR
print help information and exit.

.TP
 \fB\-i\fR
generate intermediate files from the user's answers to
questions about the options.

The files are \fIhelptext.txt\fR, \fIdeclare.txt\fR, \fIdefault.txt\fR
and \fIcode.txt\fR. These files will be written in the current dir.

.TP
 \fB\-l\fR
ask for long option names and generate code to process them. This is
meaningful only with \-i option. Presently this is a lie, I'll implement
this ASAP.

.TP
 \fB\-g\fR
generate the \fImain.c\fR, \fIgetoptions.c\fR and
\fIgetoptions.h\fR. from the above named txt files. Generate
a \fIMakefile\fR to make \fIprogram_name\fR.

The next options are only meaningful when using \-g option.

.TP
 \fB\-c\fR
number of columns in display. Default is 80 columns.

By making this a 2 stage process, the user has the
opportunity to edit the text files if required before
program generation.
